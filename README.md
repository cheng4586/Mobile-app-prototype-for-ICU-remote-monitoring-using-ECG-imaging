We develop a novel remote electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) monitoring mobile application for Intensive care units (ICUs) on the platform of Android Studio. This application is a pioneering effort that enables real-time 3D tele-monitoring of cardiac health with high accuracy using ECGI in ICUs. This is in stark contrast with the traditional ECG monitoring in clinical settings. This novel toolkit for tele-monitoring eschew heavy investment in major hardware and paves the way to transform cardiac care management in ICUs
